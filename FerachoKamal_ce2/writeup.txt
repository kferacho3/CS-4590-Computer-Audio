The background noise was recorded outside in my backyard during the day. I was in the middle of the woods walking through tall grass and you can hear me tapping against wood and brushing pass the tall grass towards the end. The voice over is simply me stating a fact about computer science and my feelings of computer audio thus far.\

I used Logic Pro X instead of OceanOgraphy as an audio editor. I will be using this in replacement of OceanOgraphy for future assignments if that is ok!
