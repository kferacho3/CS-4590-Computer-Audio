# (5pts) Have an introductory paragraph describing what your overall guiding theme/philosophy would be for your sound track and how your new sounds would fit with the visual information.

The video game clearly has a lot of moving and interactive elements that could use sonification that could especially be useful for  hearing and visually impaired people. It appears as though the game is catered towards children so the sound elements would have to reflect that and be pleasant with a satisfying element to keep the player engaged. It is imperative to ensure that the audio can accommodate people who are visually impaired, so some spatialization should be incorporated to help distinguish where objects are coming from and the impact each object has on the player when they interact with them. 

# (20 pts) A list of at least five pieces of information that are critical to gameplay that are conveyed to the player via visuals 

From first glance, the video needs to have a constant musical loop appropriate for the game, sound effects for the bubbles that come and pop and a sound indicating the player got hit when they are attacked by jellyfish. There are interactive elements such as clams for the player to select when answer questions, so these clams could each use a sound effect (one indicating the clam was opened for selection, and anther actually indicating the selection itself).  Another source of information includes informational text boxes used to guide the player throughout the game. This could be from a help box, controls on how to play the game, or progressional information in regards to the player. \

# (25 pts) For each information type describe how you might sonify that information (e.g. modify a parameter of existing game sound effect to encode data, use spatialization, add a new sound cue that fits thematically with the existing sound track etc.) and motivate your design decisions by referencing concepts about auditory displays, sonification, and accessible/universal design that we have either discussed in class or that you find via independent research.

The looping background music will incorporate ducking when the player receives a messages that temporarily stops the game. There can be various sound cues added that represents the other interactive elements such as the clams, the jellyfish, and the bubbles. Some other techniques that could help would include a sound slider to help understand the trajectory of the jellyfish and bubbles. Also incorporating different sound effects for each of the clams to distinguish their differences since they are color coded. The text should also have a verbal play option to read the text allowed for the player. Along with using a slider, one can use spatialization as well to better represent multiple audio streams (bubbles, jelly fish, clams, background music, etc.). The text displayed to the player should have a text-to-speech option that allows the text to be read allowed and translated to the player. The player may have issues seeing when the jellyfish will come in to attack so using a warning sound in the direction of the jellyfish whenever it’s near is an appropriate sonification and spatialization technique to help the player have a better experience. 



I wanted to fade in and fade out the musical loop to mimic a ducking experience since that’s when the text box comes in to explain how to play the game but was limited to the functions of the video editor I was using. I used the same sound cue for the warnings of the jellyfish, but different versions of it to help indicate the direction it was coming from.
