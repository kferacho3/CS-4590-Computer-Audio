The sound cues used for this assignment trie to emulate the sounds already created by apple for their products, but in regards to the devices shown within the video. Some sounds had a futuristic touch to it such as the opening and closing of the arm device, which I felt was appropriate given the aesthetic of the design. I personally believe that apple products did a great job creating sound cues for all of the interactions for their devices as they are not annoying and obnoxious (scrolling, clicking, etc.). In terms of the video exporting incorrectly, for some reason it would only export starting with my first sound implementation and my last sound implementation. I was using Logic Pro X and sadly could not figure out how to resolve this issue.
